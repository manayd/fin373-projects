This github repository holds all the homeworks and the final project for FIN373 - Policy Research Lab. 
The entirety of this class was in R.
Homeworks 1-11 include my work on linear regression models, difference in differences (DiD) regression, unsupervised learning methods like k-means clustering and PCA, and text analysis.
For the final project, I have included the R code as well as the final presentation which goes through our data collection methods, data cleaning, linear regression model, unsupervised learning, and conclusions from our findings.
